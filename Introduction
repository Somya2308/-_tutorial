Python is classified as a multi-paradigm programming language 

invented by Guido Van Rossum in 1991

It is an open source programming language

It is a high level, procedural, object oriented,imperative,reflective, aspect oriented

it is a functional programming language 

extension is .py and executes code dynamilcally i.e no output code generated so can say has dynamic typing

available on multiple platforms

capable of supporting structured exception handling

multithreading supported which used in interactive applications and database applications
(multitheading is extensively used in games)

has support for sockets. eg of socket bit torrent

can be used to develop gui applications ,data centric applications

objective: emphasis code readability
syntax simpler and can write same code written in other languages in fewer lines
versions 3.4.x and 2.7.x; both being developed simultaneously 

types of typing supporter:
duck: eg.if we create an integer it will always behave as an integer
dynamic: interpreter infers type of variable based on value assigned to it
strong:eg if variable is integer we can only assign integer values to it

adopted by various systems and companies
major implementations CPython,Jython,PyPy, Iron-Python which runs on .net and developed by microsoft,Rpython,tackless python,pyjamas:python to javascript

python influenced by many languages some of which are C,Cpp,Pearl,Java,Modula3
python has influenced f#, go, ruby,javascript,swift, d, groovy

""":used to print multiline outputs
check code file named "multiline.py" for example and better understanding


we can use '\n' for new line


how we use numbers?

BODMAS used in calculations
we can also directly use comparison operators in print function to get boolean outputs

Basic data types:
Note:type of data determined at run time because dynamic typing(check code "determine the types" to explicitly find the type of variable)

1)Numerical :int, long, float, decimal and complex
2)String
3)Boolean
4)None/null

Check code for escape sequences "escape_sequences"
